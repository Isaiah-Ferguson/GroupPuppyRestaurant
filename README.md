Puppy Restaurant

In this group project we will try to replicate a puppy restaurant promt that was given to us in Adobe XD.
We will be using Branches the push / pull functions of github.
We will be working with Bootstrap HTML and CSS in order to make the static website.
The website has to be fully responsive for mobile and tablet.
Each member of the group has their own pages.
Madeline - Home, and Menu.
Samuel - Catering.
Isaiah - About and Photo.
